I have not documented the code very well. 

I made this game for my kids. Please do not post it anywhere as there are copyright images in the game. I made this just for my kids as a fun game and not to publish or sell. 

I am posting this code as an example for study only.

This is an unfinished game, it does not keep score, change levels or other cool things. 

you can fly left, right, up and down. you can shoot all the ships and astriods that fly at you. If you collide with any of them the game is over.
